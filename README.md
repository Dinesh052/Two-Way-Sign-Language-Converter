# Two-Way-Sign-Language-Converter

This innovative project that facilitates communication between hearing individuals and the Deaf community. Using technologies like computer vision and machine learning, this tool can accurately interpret American Sign Language (ASL) signs. When a user signs in ASL in front of a camera, the converter instantly converts the signs into written text or audible speech, making it easier for hearing individuals to understand. Additionally, it can also process spoken language and translate it into ASL signs, ensuring effective communication for the Deaf community.
